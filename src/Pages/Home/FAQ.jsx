              There are two types of the IELTS test: IELTS Academic and IELTS
              General Training. <br />
              <br />
              The IELTS Academic test is for people applying for higher
              education or professional registration in an English-speaking
              environment. It reflects some of the features of academic language
              and assesses whether you are ready to begin studying or training.{" "}
              <br /> <br />
              The IELTS General Training test is for those who are going to
              English speaking countries for secondary education, work
              experience or training programs. It is also a requirement for
              migration to Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK. The test
              focuses on basic survival skills in broad social and workplace
              contexts. Listening and Speaking are the same for both tests, but
              the subject matter of the Reading and Writing sections differs
              depending on which test you take.{" "}
